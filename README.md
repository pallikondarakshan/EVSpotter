## ⚙️ Setup Instructions  

## 1️⃣ Install Requirements  
- [Download XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)  
- Make sure Apache & MySQL are running  

## 2️⃣ Setup Project  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pallikondarakshan/EV-Spotter.git
   
2. Copy project folder into your XAMPP htdocs directory

    For example:
   ``` bash
   C:/xampp/htdocs/EV-Spotter/

## 3️⃣ Setup Database

Open phpMyAdmin (http://localhost/phpmyadmin)

Create a new database: spotter

Import dataset from /database/evspotter.csv (or .sql if you have it)

## 4️⃣ Run the App

Open browser and visit: http://localhost/EV-Spotter/index.php

## 🧪 Testing

✔️ Unit Testing: Verified pincode input & data retrieval

✔️ Integration Testing: Frontend ↔ Backend ↔ Database

✔️ Acceptance Testing: Real-world pincode searches across Hyderabad

---

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

📍 Google Maps API integration for precise geolocation

⭐ User ratings & reviews for charging stations

🔌 Station grouping (fast charging, standard charging)

📱 Progressive Web App (PWA) support for mobile

---

## ⭐ Why This Project Stands Out

🔥 Tackles a real-world sustainability challenge (EV adoption)

🏗️ Full-stack development: Frontend + Backend + Database

💡 Designed for scalability & future integration

🌍 Promotes green transportation & sustainable mobility
